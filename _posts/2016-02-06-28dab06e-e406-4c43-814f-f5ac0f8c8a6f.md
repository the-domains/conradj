99 Grid Problems

1\. How do you get to your admin site? [grid.io][0]? Nope. [passport.thegrid.io/account][1]? Nope.  [help.thegrid.io][2]. No. Neither is there a login page or link from  [thegrid.ai/conradj][3] or [thegrid.ai][4]. Jeez.

Still stuck? It's [app.thegrid.io][5]. Hope that helps :-)

2\. My self Authored Post only shows the first paragraph. No idea how to fix this.

3\. The post I created [from a different site][6] has just grabbed random text to show on my page.

> Who wears a taupe blazer? interesting, wonderful, or disturbing way. A computer is a clock with benefits. They all work the same, doing second-grade math, one step at a time: Tick, take a number and put it in box one. Tick, take another number, put it in box two.

Wow.

4\. The help pages are not helpful.
