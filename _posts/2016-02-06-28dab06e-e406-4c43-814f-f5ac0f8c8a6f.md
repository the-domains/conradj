5, no 6, no 7, no 8, no...9 Grid Problems

# thegrid made this panda sad.

1\. How do you get to your admin site? [thegrid.io][0]? Nope. [passport.thegrid.io/account][1]? Nope, can't get to my site from there.  [help.thegrid.io][2]. No. Neither is there a login page or link from  [thegrid.ai/conradj][3] or [thegrid.ai][4]. Jeez.

Still stuck? It's [app.thegrid.io][5]. Hope that helps.

2\. My self Authored Posts only shows the first paragraph. No idea how to fix this. EDIT: See post 6 for a fix.

3\. The post I created [from a different site][6] has just grabbed random text from it to show on my page:

> Who wears a taupe blazer? interesting, wonderful, or disturbing way. A computer is a clock with benefits. They all work the same, doing second-grade math, one step at a time: Tick, take a number and put it in box one. Tick, take another number, put it in box two.

Wow.

4\. The help pages are not helpful. How do you really create content? How do you make changes to the design? What effect do the sliders do, if you're not going to give immediate feedback?

5\. I just published this page. Content has been cut off, and my site just got randomly redesigned. I preferred the old design.

6\. OK, I just read the help again to try and work out how to get my content to show:

_You can choose from **one** of three post types..._

Note - you can choose from ONE of three options. Maybe make this a radio button selection then.

7\. Photos. Anytime you want to use a photo, in a post or when choosing one from a design, you have to upload from your local computer. Be good to choose from a URL.

8\. The animated pic should be with item 6\. In the edit screen it is.

9\. The design doesn't really change much - I can choose 2 very different designs and the site still looks pretty similar.
